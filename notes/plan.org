* Plan
- Monolog
- Sublogs
- Commit hooks
- Mainline snapshots
- Sublog snapshots
- Version enforcement

  
** DONE MonoLog
- updates staged
  - add products, see products after

- updates committed
  - store to memory
  - added products visible after recreation
  
** TODO SubLogs
A SubLogSpace model should be developed, that provides an interface via its .view() very similar to the top-level LogSpace
We want to then test that this subsidiary interface passes muster



* ToDo
- store to file
- LogImpl.load: only load the latest
- LogImpl.load: check for snapshots
