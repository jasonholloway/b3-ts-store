what happens if, after we dispatch a Commit request
(which samples the latest slices and commits based on this)

a Reset is also dispatched, but before the Committer dispatches a SliceCommitted?
then it's fine: the slices have been cleared for us
the LogSpec will come through from below to sure everything up

-------------------------

if the Committer needs to know whether a Slice is completed, and what its number is also -
then the /SliceStack/ shouldn't be suppressing the Slice articulation

it'll output then an Observable<Era>

-------------------------

So the merging of all slices etc is for the consumer to do...

the SliceStack then just handles /Reset/ and /SliceCommitted/
and serves a stream of eras and slices, from which downstreams can bungle together a momentary view of state

that's it...

which means some of our tests, again, are misplaced...
